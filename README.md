# Timesheets

**Creates a timesheet that complies to the german 'Act on the Regulation of a General Minimum Wage' - specifically the 'MiLoG ยง17 Preparation and holding of documents'.**

In Germany, mini-jobbers (including working students or student assistants) are obliged to document their working hours.
The employer usually provides an Excel template file and expects a signed scan at the end of the month.
This can take longer than the job itself - here is the solution.
Enjoy!

## How to use

1. Clone the project
2. Install the requirements
3. Put the required files in the same folder as the python file
   - `template.xlsx`
   - `sign.png`
4. Execute the `main.py`
5. Print/mail the `result.pdf`

## The law

In accordance with ยง17 of the MiLoG, an employer who employs workers in accordance with ยง8 (1) of the Fourth Book of the Social Code or in the economic sectors or branches of the economy specified in ยง2a of the Act to Combat Clandestine Employment is also obliged to _record the beginning, end and duration of the daily working time_ of these workers no later than the end of the seventh calendar day following the day on which the work is performed and to keep these records for at least two years starting from the time relevant for the recording.
The current interpretation allows to postpone the creation of those timesheets to the end of the calendar month.
